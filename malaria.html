          <h2>MALARIA</h2><hr>
          <h4>Introduction</h4><hr> <br>
          <p>Malaria, a protozoan infection transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes, is
              the most important parasitic disease of humans. Around 3.3 billion people
              in endemic areas are at risk of malaria and 7250 million clinical cases occur
              annually. Nearly 1 million die annually, largely African infants and young
              children. There are four human malaria parasite species 
              (Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae), and human infection with the
              macaque malaria species P. knowlesi is increasingly recognized in Southeast
              Asia. The clinical manifestations of malaria vary greatly, depending on a
              number of factors including the infecting malaria species (P. falciparum
              causing the vast majority of severe disease), transmission intensity, and the
              degree of resistance, acquired and genetic, of the host.</p><br>

              <h5>Life cycle and transmission </h5><br>
                    <p>The life cycle of the malarial parasite alternates between the sexual cycle
                    in the invertebrate host (the female Anopheles mosquito) and the asexual
                    cycle in the vertebrate host (in this case, human).</p> <br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Transmission occurs when the mosquito, requiring blood for the
                    development of her eggs, bites the human host and injects motile
                    sporozoites into the bloodstream, which then invade
                    hepatocytes, where they develop into liver schizonts.</li>
                    <li>When each schizont ruptures, thousands of merozoites are released
                    that invade red cells and initiate that part of the cycle responsible for
                    all the clinical manifestations of the disease.</li>
                    <li>Either immediately after release from the liver or (in the case of
                    P. falciparum) after several asexual cycles, some parasites develop into
                    longer-lived, morphologically distinct sexual forms, gametocytes.
                    <li>Male and female gametocytes ingested by mosquitoes taking a blood
                    meal combine to form a zygote, which matures into an ookinete that
                    encysts in the gut wall.</li>
                    <li>There an oocyst develops, expanding by asexual division until it bursts,
                    releasing numerous sporozoites that migrate to the salivary glands.
                    These await inoculation into a human host when the mosquito next
                    feeds.</li> 
                    </ul><br>

                    <p>The malaria parasite life cycle involves two hosts. During a blood meal, a malaria-infected female Anopheles
                     mosquito inoculates sporozoites into the human host <mark>The number 1</mark>. Sporozoites infect liver cells 
                     <mark>The number 2</mark> and mature into schizonts <mark>The number 3</mark>,\
                      which rupture and release merozoites <mark>The number 4</mark>.
                      (Of note, in P. vivax and P. ovale a dormant stage [hypnozoites] can persist in the liver and cause relapses by 
                      invading the bloodstream weeks, or even years later.) After this initial replication in the liver 
                      (exo-erythrocytic schizogony The letter A),
                     the parasites undergo asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes (erythrocytic schizogony The letter B).
                     Merozoites infect red blood cells <mark>The number 5</mark>. The ring stage trophozoites mature into schizonts, 
                     which rupture releasing merozoites <mark>The number 6</mark>. Some parasites differentiate into sexual erythrocytic
                      stages (gametocytes) <mark>The number 7</mark>. Blood stage parasites are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease.</p>
<br>
                    <p>The gametocytes, male (microgametocytes) and female (macrogametocytes), are ingested by an Anopheles                      
                      mosquito during a blood meal <mark>The number 8</mark>. The parasites’ multiplication in the mosquito is known as 
                      the sporogonic cycle The letter C. While in the mosquito’s stomach, the microgametes penetrate the 
                      macrogametes generating zygotes <mark>The number 9</mark>. The zygotes in turn become motile and elongated (ookinetes)
                       The <mark>The number 10</mark> which invade the midgut wall of the mosquito where they develop into oocysts <mark>The number 11</mark>.
                        The oocysts grow, rupture, and release sporozoites <mark>The number 12</mark>, which make their way to 
                        the mosquito’s salivary glands. Inoculation of the sporozoites into a new human host perpetuates 
                        the malaria life cycle .</p> <br>

                    <h5>Incubation periods</h5><br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>P. falciparum 7–14d usually, but may be longer (up to 6wks) in those
                          with partial immunity or those on inadequate prophylaxis.
                               </li>
                          <li>P. vivax 12–17d, but may relapse months or years later as a result of
                              the reactivation of a dormant form in the liver called the hypnozoite.
                              </li>
                              <li> P. ovale 15–18d but may relapse months or years later as a result of
                                  the hypnozoite.
                                </li>
                                <li> P. malariae 18-40d and has no hypnozoite form.</li>
                    </ul>

          <br> <h4>KEY DIAGNOSTIC POINTS</h4><hr><br>
          
           <ul>
             <li>Patients with suspected malaria should have parasitological confirmation of diagnosis with either <mark> microscopy
             or rapid diagnostic test (RDT) </mark> before antimalarial treatment is started.</li>
             <li>Treatment based on clinical grounds shouldonly be given if diagnostic testing is not immediately accessible within 2 hours
              of patients presenting for treatment. </li>
             <li>Prompt treatment – within 24 hours of fever onset – with an effective and safe antimalarial is
               necessary to effect a cure and prevent life-threatening complications.</li>

          <h4>Investigations</h4><hr> <br>
         <h5>Microscopy: </h5><br>
         <p>Microscopy (morphologic analysis) continues to be the “gold standard” for malaria diagnosis. Parasites may be visualized
            on both thick and thin blood smears stained with Giemsa, Wright, or Wright-Giemsa stains. Giemsa is the preferred stain,
             as it allows for detection of certain morphologic features (e.g. Schüffner’s dots, Maurer’s clefts, etc.) that may 
             not be seen with the other two. Ideally, the thick smears are used to detect the presence of parasites while the 
             thin smears are used for species-level identification. Quantification may be done on both thick and thin smears.</p> <br>

             <h5>Antigen Detection:</h5><br>
             <p>In addition to microscopy and molecular methods, there are methods for detecting malaria parasites on the basis
              of antigens or enzymatic activities associated with the parasites. These methods are often packaged as individual 
              test kits called rapid diagnostic tests or RDTs.</p> <br>             
             These methods include, among others:<br>
             <ul>
             <li>detection of an antigen (histidine rich protein-2, HRP-2) associated with malaria parasites (P. falciparum)</li>
            <li>detection of a Plasmodium specific aldolase</li>
             <li>detection of a Plasmodium associated lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) either through its enzymatic activity or by immunoassay</li>
             </ul>
