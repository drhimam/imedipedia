<h3> BUYING – JUST FOR YOU!</h3> <br>

<p>What if you’re still not finding “the one?” We’ll get on the ground and prospect for your new home so that you’re not 
competing with the thousands of buyers looking at MLS properties. Yes, you heard us right. We’d rather spend our time and 
resources finding your home than wasting your time competing for homes that will sell way over your budget. Did you hear that?
 We just made buying a Toronto home easier for you, so what are you waiting for?</p> <br>

 <h3>SELLING WITH US</h3> <br>

 <p>BUT HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?<br><br>
  It happened because, with so many agents out there, many consumers assume that we’re all the same 
and that anyone who has a real estate license must be an expert in the Toronto market. They also assume 
that if it’s a seller’s market and homes are selling quickly that they don’t need a full-service agent who spends
 money on things like staging, social media exposure, marketing, etc.</p> <br>

 <p>OUR FULL SERVICE PREMIUM PACKAGE (WITH NO HIDDEN COSTS OR FEES) MEANS THAT WE PAY FOR:</p> <br>
<ul style="padding-left:15%;">

<li>Staging </li>
<li>Professional print materials</li>

  <h3>CLIENT REVIEW</h3>
  <br><br>
  <blockquote style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%; text-align: justify;">         
  “Md is a fantastic realtor for a myriad of reasons; he is: * incredibly knowledgeable about the community 
  * a great listener; he takes the time to understand your needs and wants and navigates the home search wonderfully 
  * attentive and responsive; he always makes herself available and keeps you informed every step of the way 
  * an expert in all aspects of the process (the search, the negotiation, the steps prior to close, etc.) 
  * unbelievably patient; he never once lost her good-nature, even when I was tired of us :) 
  * always looking out for her clients' best interests 
  * well connected to service providers (great recommendations for assisting with getting the home move in ready) And 
  above all else he genuinely cares! Md always conveyed to us that he just wanted to make sure we were happy and 
  because of this we were able to do just that - we are incredibly happy and owe that in large part to Md and his assistant Lacey!
  Truly an A++ and there aren't enough words to express our gratitude for a great home buying experience!”
